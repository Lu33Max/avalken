## The project

This project was created as part of my studies in Media Informatics at the University of Applied Sciences Mittweida for the module "Java II". Students were tasked to create a basic game concept that could be developed over the span of a single semester using the Java programming language as basis. It was required of the resulting game to have a minimum playtime of half an hour as well as include a dedicated multiplayer mode for at least two local players.

The project was realized using the Java Swing library as basis for all GUI-related operations. Other functionalitites are all self-developed with no further external libraries or packages.

## The game

The game is a 2D action-adventure in a top-down perspective with real-time combat system like the older 2D "The Legend of Zelda" games, with additional role-playing elements such as a levelling system and stats. The world is set in a medieval fantasy era and designed in a pixel art style.

In the game world, players encounter NPCs who assist them on their journey, monsters that must be defeated, and discover new items (such as a shield, bombs, a bow, a lamp, etc.) to interact with their environment. Players primarily use a sword for combat, but the use of items is also possible. By defeating monsters, players can level up their character and increase their own stats (health, attack, defence, etc.). With the newly acquired items and increased stats, players can attempt the temples scattered throughout the world. These temples contain puzzles that can only be solved through the correct use of items, as well as battles against difficult enemies. The game is considered completed when all dungeons have been cleared.

In the two-player mode, players can choose from a selection of temples specifically created for this mode. These temples include new puzzles that can only be solved through cooperation between both players. The levelling system is disabled for this mode. The time taken to complete a temple is saved and is intended to encourage players to continually surpass their best time.
